Use this rule when generating a diagram with the plait MCP

- Support two modes: flowchart and freehand, you can choose different modes according to the scene, or combine the two modes to complete richer whiteboard drawings
- Before drawing according to user instructions, you can think about the flow chart or the structure and layout of the content you want to draw, and then create elements based on the layout
- Create elements one by one, not in batch. Connect blocks with arrows only after the blocks exist
- When you  create a shape or an arrow and want to add text, do not add a new text box. Instead put the text inside the shape/arrow
- When drawing arrow:
  - make sure they connect to the shapes the are linked to
  - if it as text on it, make sure the arrow is long enough to display the entire text
- When creating a shape that will have shapes in it:
  - align the text to the center of the shape
  - make sure the shape is big enough to contain everything 
  - Leave enough distance between the geometries to leave some space for the arrow lines to make the structure look better
