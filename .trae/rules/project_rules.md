<!-- Use this rule when generating a diagram with the plait MCP

- Use the default (hand writing front)
- Create elements one by one, not in batch. Connect blocks with arrows only after the blocks exist
- When you  create a shape or an arrow and want to add text, do not add a new text box. Instead put the text inside the shape/arrow
- When drawing arrow:
  - make sure they connect to the shapes the are linked to
  - if it as text on it, make sure the arrow is long enough to display the entire text
- When creating a shape that will have shapes in it:
  - align the text to the top left corner (use align_elements)
  - make sure the shape is big enough to contain everything  -->
